These projects include Iris Flower Classification, Unemployment Rate Analysis, Car Price Prediction, Email Spam Detection, and Sales Prediction, all built using Python and machine learning techniques.

# Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

This repository contains the tasks completed during my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The five projects focus on applying data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems. Below, you will find detailed descriptions and solutions to each of the following tasks:

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
In this task, I built a machine learning model using the **Iris Flower Dataset** to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. I used various flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to train the model.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Objective:** Train a classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on provided measurements.

---

### Task 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis with Python
This task involved analyzing the **unemployment rate** during the Covid-19 pandemic. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine trends, patterns, and the effects of the pandemic on unemployment rates.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Objective:** Analyze the unemployment data and visualize how the unemployment rate has evolved over time.

### Task 3: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
In this project, I created a machine learning model to predict **car prices** based on several features like brand, horsepower, mileage, and other car specifications. The task involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas  
- **Objective:** Build a regression model to predict car prices based on various car features.

---

### Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
In this task, I developed an **email spam detector** using machine learning. The model was trained to classify emails into **spam** or **non-spam** categories using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, NLP (Natural Language Processing)  
- **Objective:** Build a spam email classifier that filters out spam emails from legitimate ones.

---

### Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict **future sales** based on factors such as advertising budget, target demographics, and marketing platform. This task aimed to help businesses forecast sales and optimize their marketing strategies.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas  
- **Objective:** Predict future sales of a product based on various marketing and demographic factors.

## Technologies & Tools Used:
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub

## Key Learnings:
- Gained hands-on experience applying machine learning algorithms to classification and regression problems.
- Improved skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Learned how to solve real-world business problems using data science and machine learning techniques.
